When tables are needed to be printed in the code, they are using the **DBTablePrinter** utility class by Hami Galip Torun

It prints the table in this format:
+--------+------------+------------+-----------+--------+-------------+
| EMP_NO | BIRTH_DATE | FIRST_NAME | LAST_NAME | GENDER |  HIRE_DATE  |
+--------+------------+------------+-----------+--------+-------------+

+--------+------------+------------+-----------+--------+-------------+
